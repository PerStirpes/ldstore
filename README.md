## How to run

### Install the Gatsby CLI

```bash
npm i -g gatsby-cli
```

### Install dependencies with Yarn

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the `develop` command

```bash
yarn start
```

This will query the shopify api, optimize images, and launch a dev server!
Any style changes should live-reload.

This is the LaunchDarkly store, where we make swag, stickers, and other LaunchDarkly goodies available to contributors and LaunchDarkly enthusiasts.

#### Run the `clean` command to clear the gatsby cache

```bash
yarn clean
```

#### Run the `shame` command to lint the project

```bash
yarn shame
```
