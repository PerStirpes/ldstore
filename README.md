  <summary><strong>I wanted to order something but it's out. How long will it take before it's back in stock?</strong></summary>

&nbsp; <!-- leave this here to avoid smashing the text against the summary -->

Some of the swag has been selling like hotcakes (only less tasty and a providing a bit more coverage). Once an item is out, it takes us about 3 weeks for it to get back in stock.

<details>
  <summary><strong>The delivery service is telling me I need to pay additional fees to get my order. I thought LaunchDarkly covered shipping costs. What gives?</strong></summary>

&nbsp; <!-- leave this here to avoid smashing the text against the summary -->

On some international orders, customs will add additional taxes, duties, and other fees. This is unpredictable, and we have no way of knowing if or when it will happen, or how much it will be. If this happens to you, there is, unfortunately, nothing else LaunchDarkly can do. You are responsible for paying any additional fees imposed as part of the customs process. Thanks for your understanding!
